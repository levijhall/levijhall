## Greetings! 👋 I'm Levi.

A Data Scientist with a background in Physics and Mathematics, trying to make sense of it all.

- 🌱 I’m currently **learning software engineering** and **database management**.
- 😄 Pronouns: **He**/**Him**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I love to bake 🍞** and **climb mountains 🌄.**

Some of my favorite quotes to live by:

"A mathematician may say anything he pleases, but a physicist must be at least partially sane." - Attrib. J.W. Gibbs

"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived." - *Walden; or Life in the Woods*

"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled." - Richard Feynman
